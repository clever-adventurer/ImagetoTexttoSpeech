# ImagetoTexttoSpeech
This repository contains two versions of converting the same image and a different image. Both image files "AC 318.jpg" and "Baking.jpg" and the expected audio clip [clip] are also included.

There are two versions of code partially because I accidently left my computer at Olin and needed to recreate it and also to compare the results. The second version will be added as soon as get access to my computer (a couple days or so). Version A is the redone code and Version B will be the original code.
